<p class="information">Sam makes use of Jiaobei blocks. Jiaobei blocks or moon blocks (Mandarin 筊杯, jiǎo bēi, lit. "bamboo cups") are wooden divination tools originating from China, which are used in pairs and thrown to answer a yes or no question. They are made out of wood or bamboo and carved into a crescent shape. Each block is round on one side (known as the yin side) and flat on the other (known as the yang side).</p>
